1. Set a time to be counted (e.g. 10s).
2. Push start button, and the time will gradually vanish.
3. Two players count on their own, when they think it's around the set time, push the button.
4. When all of the two players pushed the button, the result will be revealed.
5. Push reset button to start over again.

This is a supplementary web-game for an interactive 3D-printed phone holder.
